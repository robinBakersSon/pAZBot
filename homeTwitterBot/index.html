    <p>"Home is a primary category in the Indigenous world, in Native art, and in Native studies, but Home/Not Home is meant to evoke breadth and depth not limited to indigeneity, race, gender, or other cateogories of identification.  </p><p>Home/Not Home gives voice to the persistence of violence, absence, rejection, and psychic violation even as it reaches toward peace, balance, respect, and integrityâ€”often through and within each other." </p><p>- HOME/NOT HOME: An American Studies Art Exhibit / Denver, Colorado/Colorado Convention Center</p>
